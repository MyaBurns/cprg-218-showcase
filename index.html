    Notting Hill stars Anna, Julia Roberts as a celebrity, and William, Hugh Grant as a travel-book, bookstore owner. This is the story about how they fall in love, and face challenges when paparazzi reveal their secret relationship. I highly enjoyed this movie because I thought that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant worked well together, and I thought that Hugh Grant’s roommate, Rhys Ifans, was funny. </p>

    Clueless stars Cher, Alicia Silverstone as a sweet rich girl, and Josh, Paul Rudd as her cute “ex” step-brother. This movie follows Cher throughout her struggles as a teenager, and her search for love. This is one of my favorite movies because I can watch it on repeat and it has many funny quotes I love to use. </p>

    10 Things I Hate About You stars Kat, Julia Stiles as an independent feminist, and Patrick, Heath Ledger as a charming “bad” boy. This movie is based off of W. Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. In this movie, Patrick takes a bet to date Kit so that her sister is also able to go out, as this is their father’s rule. I like this movie because I felt that Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger’s personalities complimented each other well, and it is interesting to see the modern twists of the much older play it is based on. </p>

    She’s All That stars Laney, Rachael Leigh Cook as a nerdy painter with no interest in love, and Zack, Freddie Prinze Jr. as the popular guy. This movie follows Laney and Zack as Zack attempts to turn her into prom queen due to a bet he holds with his friends. I like this movie because it is a classic teen movie with a classic storyline. </p>

    <p>She’s the Man stars Viola, Amanda Bynes as a humorous soccer player who is not aligning with her mother’s expectations, and Duke, Channing Tatum as the boy she falls in love with. When Viola’s high school soccer team is cut, and the boys don’t allow the girls to merge their teams together, Viola sneaks off to a private school, pretending to be her brother, so that she can get on the male soccer team to prove that girls can be just as good as guys in athleticism. This is one of my favorite movies because I like Amanda Bynes’ sarcastic humor and the way her personality shines through her acting. </p>

    Wedding Crashers stars John, Owen Wilson as a wedding crasher with his friend Jeremy (Vince Vaughn), and Claire, Rachel McAdams as the girl John falls in love with - even though she is engaged to someone else. This movie follows John and Jeremy as they crash weddings to meet girls. However, at one particular wedding, John finds himself quickly falling for Claire. Although this movie is a little different from the teenaged rom-coms in the rest of this list, I like this movie because it is humorous, and I like Rachel McAdams. </p>
